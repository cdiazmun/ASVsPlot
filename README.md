# ASVsPlot
This is a guide to plot the relative abundance of genera/species of interest based on amplicon sequencing data. The script is based on a more basic, previous one made by Florac De Bruyne. The script is meant for amplicon sequences that have been processed using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2017, 2019).
